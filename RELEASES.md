# Releases

> Note: ES3/IE8 compatibility will be removed in the future v3.x.x releases (scheduled for mid-late 2022), so if you need to retain ES3 compatibility you will need to remain on the 2.x.x versions of the SDK or your runtime will need install polyfill's to your ES3 environment before loading / initializing the SDK.

## 2.8.3 (May 3rd, 2022)

- Updates React Plugin to v3.3.3 (with v2.8.2 as dependency) -- using React 17
- Updates React Native Plugin to 2.5.3 (with v2.8.2 as dependency)
- Updates Chrome Debug Extension to 0.3.3

This release has been manually validated to work with IE8 both directly and by extending the provided classes. While the previous version 2.8.2 also fully supported IE8 it did not handle classes extending the all of Core classes correctly in multiple cases. If you need to support IE8 it is strongly advised that you upgrade to, validate and use this version.

### Changelog

- #1831 Updates to dynamicProto() v1.1.6 which provides a final edge case fix for IE8
  - [#50](https://github.com/microsoft/DynamicProto-JS/issues/50) [IE8] Fix in 1.1.5 only handles 2 levels of dynamically nested classes
- #1828 Update README.md to redirect to Node.JS
- #1829 Extracting HOC tracked component class base for re-use

## 2.8.2 (May 2nd, 2022)

- Updates React Plugin to v3.3.2 (with v2.8.1 as dependency) -- using React 17
- Updates React Native Plugin to 2.5.2 (with v2.8.1 as dependency)
- Updates Chrome Debug Extension to 0.3.2

This patch release restores complete ES3 support (broken in 2.8.0) and IE8 support (broken eariler via dynamicProto()) for the Sdk.

### Changelog

- #1822 [BUG] v2.8.1 with a Hosted IE environment fails to initialize for a hosted instance of IE #1822 (#1824)
- #1823 [BUG] IE8 Support was broken by several components #1823
- Also updates to dynamicProto() v1.1.5 to restore IE8 support

## 2.8.1 (Apr 22nd, 2022)

- Updates React Plugin to v3.3.1 (with v2.8.1 as dependency) -- using React 17
- Updates React Native Plugin to 2.5.1 (with v2.8.1 as dependency)
- Updates Chrome Debug Extension to 0.3.1

This patch release restores TypeScript 3.x support for the Sdk.

### Changelog

- #1807 [BUG] Angular project doesn't build after install latest version v.2.8.0
- #1810 v2.8.0 has incompatible TypeScript 3.x type declaration
- #1812 [BUG] Browser exceptions are no longer automatically tracked after 2.8.0
- #1814 [BUG]SPFx React project doesn't build after latest version of @microsoft/application-insights-core-js v.2.8.0 got published

## 2.8.0 (Apr 16th, 2022)

- Updates React Plugin to v3.3.0 (with v2.8.0 as dependency) -- using React 17
- Updates React Native Plugin to 2.5.0 (with v2.8.0 as dependency)
- Updates Chrome Debug Extension to 0.3.0

### Potential Breaking Change

- `fetch` Ajax tracking was also been change to be on by default from this version moving forward, if you are running in an environment without `fetch` support and you are using an incompatible polyfill (that doesn't identify itself as a polyfill) or the SDK you start seeing recursive or duplicate (`fetch` and `XHR` requests) being reported you WILL need to add `disableFetchTracking` with a value of `true` to your configuration to disable this functionality.
- TypeScript 4.x required for some typings from the core EnumHelperFuncs.d.ts  (Fixed in v2.8.1)

### Significant changes

This release adds support for the SDK to

- TelemetryInitializers have been moved to `BaseCore` so they are now available as part of all Sku's and not just those using the `analytics` plugin (@microsoft/applicationinsights-analytics-js) using the `appInsights.addTelemetryInitializer(...)`
- Web Events (addEventHandler) now support "event namespaces" (similar to jQuery) to enable the removing of events by just specifying the namespace and new specific `eventOn(...)` and `eventOff(...)` API's.
- Fully unload, removing all internal event handlers (may be re-initialized) via the `appInsights.unload(...)` function.
- Dynamically add a plugin to an already initialized SDK (optionally replacing an existing) via new `appInsights.addPlugin(...)` function
- New helper to get any plugin from an initialized SDK via `appInsights.getPlugin("...identifier...")`
- Dynamically remove a plugin via the `appInsights.getPlugin("...identifier..").remove()`
- Enable / Disable any plugin (even if the plugin doesn't support disabling itself) via `appInsights.getPlugin("...identifier...").setEnabled(true/false)`
- The standard name fro the `analytics` plugin @microsoft/applicationinsights-analytics-js has been renamed and is now exported as `AnalyticsPlugin`, for backward compatibility it is also exported as it's previous name `ApplicationInsights`, if you are using it directly it is recommended that you update to use the new exported name.

While this release contains a substantial amount of additional functionality and code, there has also been significant minification efforts (which also drove some of the SDK naming) to keep the minified code around the same size. We intend to keep working on additional improvements to attempt to bring the size changes down further. However, the minification improvements do generally cause a lower level of GZip compression most because of the removal of duplicate names. The main readme for the [AISKU](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/tree/master/AISKU) has a table of the CDN base SKU sizes, as the CDN version includes all public API's (older versions for backward compatibility and newer smaller versions) when using NPM you should see smaller sizes than those shown.

> Note:
> Due to the above changes required to support the above, there may be some minor TypeScript Type compatibility warnings when you attempt to use components from v2.8.0 with older SDK's (forward compatibility), backward compatibility, using Core v2.8.0 with older components is supported and v2.8.0 is completely backward compatible. This is due to some API's now support both older (for back compat) and new enhanced arguments, we have attempted to keep these changes to a minimum.
> If you are getting typing errors such as "Argument of type 'XXXXX' os not assignable to parameter of type 'YYYY'", please ensure that you are using all v2.8.0 components and raise an issue if this does not resolve you issue. As a work around casting to work around this warning should not cause any issues.

> Due the the size of this change, the above date is the NPM release date and CDN deployment will be over an extended period.

#### XHR/Fetch enhancement

Adds additional performance data derived from the window.performance.getEntries() for the fetch or XHR request.

Configuration options
| Name | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| enableAjaxPerfTracking | false | Default false. Flag to enable looking up and including additional browser window.performance timings in the reported ajax (XHR and fetch) reported metrics. 
| maxAjaxPerfLookupAttempts | 3 | Defaults to 3. The maximum number of times to look for the window.performance timings (if available), this is required as not all browsers populate the window.performance before reporting the end of the XHR request and for fetch requests this is added after its complete.
| ajaxPerfLookupDelay | 25 | Defaults to 25ms. The amount of time to wait before re-attempting to find the windows.performance timings for an ajax request, time is in milliseconds and is passed directly to setTimeout().

#### Auto track exception React Native Plugin

This has been enabled by default in the updated version.
It can be disabled by adding the ```disableExceptionCollection``` config value with a value of true.

## 2.4.4 (Feb 5th, 2020)

### Changelog

- #1182 Fix error TS2430: Interface 'Window' incorrectly extends interface 'WindowEventHandlers'

## 2.4.3

## Changelog

- Syntax error tools/rollup-es3/src/es3/Es3Tokens.ts #1179

## 2.4.2

### ES3 Support

An additional conversion was required for ES3 support as TypeScript was adding a getter for embedding a constant enum into the Common class.

### Changelog

 - #1177 Add additional checks and polyfil for TypeScript get translations for constants

## v 2.4.1...2.4.0

### ES3 Support

With this release the source files can be loaded in an ES3 environment (IE7/8) and send requests to the server. As part of this change you will now receive requests from users using an older browser, prior to this version users using an ES3 base browser will (most likely) have been getting a javascript error, which would have caused no data to be sent.

### Enable support for reusing plugins in multiple instances of AppInsights #1132

We have added upport to enable reusing the same plugin in different instances of AppInsights, owned by the same application (but using different Instrumentation keys) is required so that they can reuse a single Plugin instance for all instances.

This changes introduces a new [`IProcessTelemetryContext`](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/blob/master/shared/AppInsightsCore/src/JavaScriptSDK/ProcessTelemetryContext.ts) interface that is passed to the processTelemetry() method so that the plugins can use the current request context for the event rather than the context during initialization.

To assist with creating plugins we have also introduced a base class that you can use for creating new plugins [BaseTelemetryPlugin](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/blob/master/shared/AppInsightsCore/src/JavaScriptSDK/BaseTelemetryPlugin.ts), details are included on the [Readme](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/blob/master/README.md)

### Changelog
#970 - Fixes #967 #969

## v 2.1.0
### Highlights

#### Source Map Support
> *You do not need to upgrade for drag and drop to work. It will work on all previous and future versions of the javascript (and Node.js) SDK

https://i.imgur.com/Efue9nU.gif
You can now drag and drop your source maps onto your Exception Telemetry in the Azure Portal to unminify your callstack. Please open an issue or use the Feedback button in the Portal if a source map you've uploaded is not working as intended. This is a first iteration and in a future update, your source maps will be automatically unminified.

#### SPA Route Change Tracking
You can set `enableAutoRouteTracking: true` to enable state based route tracking for your Single Page Application (React, Angular, Vue, etc). You do not need to install a separate plugin to use this configuration option.

This setting will cause a new Page View telemetry item to be sent each time your app's route changes (**including** Hash route changes).

### Changelog
- #920 Resolve jest testing issues when using React plugin
- #928 Make analytics plugin have last priority
- #936 Fallback to XHR Sender when beacon sender tries to send >64 KB
- #947 Add SPA route change tracking
- #948 Docs: Source map support
- #952 Re-enable `samplingPercentage` functionality
- #918, #919, #932 #933 #935 #939 #940 #951

## v 2.0.1

### trackException Change
This update has a couple of **non-breaking** API changes. Namely, `trackException` is now consistent with the Node.js SDK. The only change here is the named argument is renamed from **`error`** to **`exception`**. A shim is in place so **any existing usages of `trackException` will still work**, and the old field is marked as optional, so any type-checked files will still "compile". There are no breaking changes with this change, but you are encouraged to use `exception` as your named argument field as error will be deprecated in a future major version.

#### Old
```js
appInsights.trackException({ error: new Error() });
```
#### New
```js
appInsights.trackException({ exception: new Error() });
```

### Correlation Header Domain Whitelisting #869

Second, the ability to only send correlation headers to specific, whitelisted domains is now available as a configuration option , `correlationHeaderDomains`. It accepts an `array` of domain `strings`. Wildcards ("*") are okay. By populating this array, all other domains which your application makes requests to will **not** have correlation headers included. This setting makes it easy to avoid OPTIONS requests to services outside of your control.

You can use the inclusion list and the exclusion list in conjunction with each other to add correlation headers to a particular domain, `example.com`, and at the same time exclude headers from a prefixed version of it, `no-headers.example.com`.

###  Tag Override Change #903

Performing custom tag overrides is now more consistent with all of the other Application Insights SDKs, in that it is modified via a simple key-value dictionary. There are no breaking changes with this update, and if you are setting any tags via the old way, they will still work as they do now. You are encouraged to update them since the old way will be deprecated in a future major version release.

#### Old
```js
var telemetryInitializer = (item) => {
  item.tags.push({ "ai.cloud.role": "My Web App" });
};
appInsights.addTelemetryInitializer(telemetryInitializer);
```
#### New
```js
var telemetryInitializer = (item) => {
  item.tags["ai.cloud.role"] = "My Web App";
};
appInsights.addTelemetryInitializer(telemetryInitializer);
```

### Changelog
#869 - config: add ability to whitelist specific domains for adding correlation headers
#893 - docs: fix sample configuration settings
#899 - common: replace Array.some with Array.forEach to simplify polyfill story, add tests
#902 - snippet: add missing methods to lazy loaders
